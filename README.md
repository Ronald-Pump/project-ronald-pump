# Project Ronald Pump 💪

**Track. Analyze. Transform.**

*Project Ronald Pump* is a fitness tracking initiative designed to document and analyze our weightlifting journey using our gym's BIA (Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis) scanner. Through consistent data collection and dedication, we're turning raw metrics into meaningful insights to fuel progress and gains.

---

## 🏋️ Purpose

- Track body composition and fitness data using our gym's BIA scanner  
- Visualize progress over time with charts and analytics  
- Stay accountable and motivated with consistent data updates  
- Build a simple, transparent system for personal performance tracking  

---

## 📊 Features

- BIA scan data logging (weight, body fat %, muscle mass, etc.)  
- Progress tracking and visualizations  
- Optional goal setting and milestone tracking  
- Lightweight and easy to use

## 🧠 Data Architecture

This project uses a lightweight, serverless architecture to automatically process and store BIA scan data:

## 🧭 Architecture Overview (Initial Thoughts)

1. **📥 Upload BIA Scan**: A PDF file is uploaded to an **Amazon S3 bucket**.
2. **⚙️ Lambda Trigger**: The upload triggers an **AWS Lambda** function (Docker-based for advanced processing).
3. **🧾 PDF Processing**: The Lambda function uses **Amazon Textract** (or a custom library like `pdfplumber`) to extract text from the PDF.
4. **🧠 AI Parsing**: The raw text is sent to **OpenAI’s ChatGPT API** to convert it into structured data (JSON / tabular format).
5. **🗃️ NoSQL Storage**: The structured data is stored in **Amazon DynamoDB** as a backup and for flexible access.
6. **🛠️ Transformation**: Another Lambda (or Glue job) processes the data into a structured format (CSV/SQL-style).
7. **🧮 Structured Storage**: The processed data is queried and organized using **Amazon Athena** or **Aurora Serverless v2**.
8. **📤 Export**: Final metrics are pushed to a **Google Sheet** using the Google Sheets API for easy viewing and sharing.

This setup is event-driven, cloud-native, and cost-efficient — ideal for personal or small team use.
